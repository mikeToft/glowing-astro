## Getting started

As you found this code on my [Github glowing-astro repo](https://github.com/mikeToft/glowing-astro) I can only assume you are a developer already. Download the files to a local folder, then open the folder in your code editor. Go to your terminal and navigate to that folder. When in the folder, enter the following in the terminal:

```terminal
npm run dev
```

The instructions will point you to open _localhost:4321_ in your chosen browser. Tadaa, the website will appear.

## Get ready to create content

The site is ready for you to start writing and publishing content to the web. To do this, look in the folder structure and find _/src/content/notes_. In the notes folder create a new file with the extension _.mdx_, copy all of the _frontmatter_ below and paste it to the top of your new .mdx file.

```markdown

You will notice _isPublished_ at the end of the frontmatter. For the markdown page to appear on your website the value must be _true_. If you are still working on the content, you might wish to mark _isPublished_ with _false_. 

Underneath the frontmatter you can start writing your content. If you are unfamiliar with markdown please use my [Writing content with Markdown](https://bored-fish.vercel.app/posts/writing-with-markdown/) as a guide or cheatsheet. You will soon learn the markdown syntax and realise that it is much quicker the writing HTML.

## Functionality

### Pages

This website comprises 3 Astro web pages, home (index), about and notes. The files can be found in the _/src/pages/_ folder. You will also see two other folders called _notes_ and _tags_. Do not touch the files in these folders as they control the dynamics of what is displayed on the site. For example, the list of notes on the _Notes_ page displays published your notes in date order with the latest at the top. Ditto the tag lists.

### Components

Reusable components can be found in the  _/src/components/_ folder. You will want to add your name to the Footer component.

```js
const name = 'Your name';
```

If you choose to add another astro page such as a _Contact_ page, you will need to add a link to it in the Navigation component.

```html
 <a href='/'>Home</a>
 <a href='/about'>About</a>
 <a href='/notes'>Notes</a>
 <!--Example new link -->
 <a href='/contact'>Contact</a>
```

Notice the _href_ must not include the file extension.

Each component is structured with JavaScript (if used), HTML tags and CSS style tags. Styling is component specific and will not 'bleed' into the wider website.

### Global styling

Global styling can be found at _/src/styles/global.css_ should you want to make adjustments.

## Conclusion

The code provided here is good to go. All you need to do is:

- add some HTML content to your home page (_/src/pages/index.astro_);
- add some HTML content to your About page (_/src/pages/about.astro_);
- add your name to the name variable for the footer (_/src/components/Footer.astro_);
- create markdown _.mdx_ files for your notes;
- store your website to an online repository;
- and finally, deploy to the web.

_Enjoy_
